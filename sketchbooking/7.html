    This 'sketchbook' was one of my first forays into drawing on whatever looseleaf paper was avaialble, and collecting it into a single vessel afterward. Incredibly, this experiment was aided by the fact that the custom-ordered oversized square notepads that floated around the Smart Design office fit perfectly into a small binder from Muji.

  <p class="lh-copy f3">This sketch was the first characterization of what I call a 'Reference Point' object — a structure (often infrastructural) found in the world that I felt needed to be expressed into a contextually-removed sister-object. In this case, my observations of the handrail systems found in the New York subway system led me to believe a clothing rack that echoed the same physical form would be Really Cool.</p>
