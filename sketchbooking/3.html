  <p class="lh-copy f3 serif black">“Book 3”</p>

  <p class="lh-copy f3">
  I first bought this notebook while in my second year of design school. Around this time, I was really into sticker culture along with other arts-oriented peers, and you'll see stickers began to make their way into my sketchbooks. This book, being one of the earliest I began to attempt carrying everywhere, completely betrays my amateur attempts at a regular sketchbooking practice.
