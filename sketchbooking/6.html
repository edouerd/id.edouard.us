  <p class="lh-copy f3 serif black">“Book 6”</p>

  <p class="lh-copy f3">
    In my last  year of design school, I took an extracurricular letterpress and bookbinding course, where I learned to do just those things. This book was a shoddily-constructed perfect-bound book that used incredibly luscious heavy weight paper I loved to draw on. It didn't really find a regular use until several months into my work at IBM. At this point, I used the sketchbook to roughly define and wireframe interfaces.
