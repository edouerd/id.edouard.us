    This sketchbook quickly become one of the more worn-down ones I own — it was intentially bought as a 'shop notebook' while at Smart Design, or one I'd keep permanently in the shop for notetaking purposes while physically prototyping projects. Over its lifespan, I ended up carrying it in various bags outside of the shop, sitting on it while in my back pocket, and the covers quickly wore down and fell off.
