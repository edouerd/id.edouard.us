  <p class="lh-copy ph2 measure-wide">
    This sketchbook was one of the first to be filled with academic projects and products after working at Smart Design. I distinctly recally having a somewhat disintegrated sketchbooking (and sketching) rigour, as sketching wasn't the utmost area of focus at Smart. <br> As I had been newly keyed into the power of rapid physical prototyping, this book ended up being used heavily for live client-oriented design explanation, and roughly mocking up storyboards and user flows, to be later rendered at a higher fidelity.
