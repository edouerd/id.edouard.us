  This sketchbook was the first I had begun to populate after joining IBM Design in late 2013. I had just began to formulate the beginnings of a note-taking system in which I wrote textual notes on the right, and idly sketched on the left. Over the first few months, this book would be filled with all sorts of organizational notes, research records, phone numbers, and sticky notes.
