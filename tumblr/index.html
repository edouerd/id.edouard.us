    Hi there — At the moment, I’m way too busy to update this ‘project(s) page’. There’s way too much work to be done! In the meantime, here’s a concrete listing of stuff I’m working on these days:
  </p>

  <ol class="lh-copy f4 pl0">
    <li>Tumblr 1:1 Messaging</li>
    <li>Activity and Notifications</li>
    <li>Secret Projects</li>
    <li>Hack Day Ephemera</li>
    <li>Tumblr Labs</li>
    <li>New Spatial Models</li>
    <li>Security and Moderation</li>
    <li>and Much Much More.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="lh-copy f4">
    We're a small and scrappy team of 4 product designers in a company of around 300 people or so, working in a greater Creative Team of 12 people. Collectively, everything user-facing passes through us.
