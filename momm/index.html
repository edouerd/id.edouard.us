    Methods of Mass Manufacture (MoMM) is an open curriculum I'm developing under the <a href="https://github.com/learning-gardens" class="link lg-green">Learning Gardens</a> initative. The overarching goal of this study is to convey a complete understanding of how industrially-produced objects are defined, produced, and assembled across globally-spanning supply chains. <br> <br>My hope is that with a better understanding of 1.) product design at scale, 2.) high-level materials science, and 3.) manufacturing methodologies, anyone passing through this learning material will gain a better understanding of the mass-produced world around them.
  </p>
  <p class="lh-copy f3 pl2">While no formal syllabus has been assembled thus far, I'm constantly updating the materials I have within MoMM's <a href="https://github.com/learning-gardens/methods-of-mass-manufacture" class="link blue">Github repository</a>. If you'd like to contribute towards this project, or help out in any way, feel free to send issues and pull requests my way. :^)</p>
